# USING YAML CONFIGURATION FILES HAS BEEN DEPRECATED!
MakeFiles: True
Cleanup: True
AutoPush: Off
# The AutoPush flag pushes the changes automatically in the end
#
# Change the value of MakeFiles to false if: 
# You do not want the program to automatically make 'commit' and 'addfiles' files
# Change it to true if you do want that behaviour
#
# The cleanup flag just deletes those files upon exit
